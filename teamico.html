  <h3>
    
    Ico is an action-adventure game made in 2001, similar to that of The Last Guardian and Shadow of the Colossus. Named after both the game and the studio, a boy named Ico was born with horns that his village rejected, since they see it as a bad omen. Ico was then locked away in an abandoned fortress, and he sets out to escape with a girl named Yorda and keeps her safe from the creatures that try to drag her back.

      The Last Guardian is an action-adventure game that takes place in ancient ruins. In this game, you play as a boy who found himself in a large hole away from his town and with strange tattoos on his body, when he soon finds out that he was in the hole with one of the infamous "man eaters;" Trico; a beast with seperate body parts from different animals. As the game progresses, you eventually become friends with Trico and together try to find your homes.
